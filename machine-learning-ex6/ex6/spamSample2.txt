Hi, there are 3 reasons why machine learning is so popular right now:

The field has matured both in terms of identity and in terms of methods and tools.
There is an abundance of data available.
There is an abundance of computation to run methods.
An example of this popularity is the response to Stanford's online machine learning course that had more than 100K people showing expressions of interest in the first year it ran. That is crazy!
 
Have you noticed this trend of smarter and smarter algorithms and bigger and bigger data in the tech space?

Machine learning is a hot topic right now.
